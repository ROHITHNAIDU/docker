# Docker Project

I did a small docker project under the guidance of Mr.Vimal Daga sir, By attending his Docker training under IIEC_RISE campaign.

In this project a Wordpress, Joomla framework, Mysql database server is launched on top of Docker using Redhat linux (RHEL8) as Base Operating system.

Here Docker plays a major role, due to any reasons if our site goes down then, the same site can be launched within a second, that is the power of Docker. 

Docker installs, reboots, login, and launches the O.S with in a second.

Here in my project I have Redhat8 linux with docker software already installed, then wordpress, joomla, mysql images are downloaded from Dockerhub.
