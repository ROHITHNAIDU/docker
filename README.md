# Docker Project

I did a small docker project under the guidance of Mr.Vimal Daga sir, By attending his Docker training under IIEC_RISE campaign.

In this project a Wordpress, Joomla framework, Mysql database server is launched on top of Docker using Redhat linux (RHEL8) as Base Operating system.

Here Docker plays a major role, due to any reasons if our site goes down then, the same site can be launched within a second, that is the power of Docker. 

Docker installs, reboots, login, and launches the O.S with in a second.

Here in my project I have Redhat8 linux with docker software already installed, then wordpress, joomla, mysql images are downloaded from Dockerhub.

In Docker we can launch the O.S in 2 ways, one way is through manually writing the commands and launching the O.S, another way is to use Docker-Compose tool, where code is used as infrastructure, another advantage of docker-compose is that it can be used for defining and running multi-container docker applications/OS.

In this project i have used docker-compose and i created a docker-compose.yml file, In this file i have written the code to launch Mysql database server, wordpress and joomla and i have linked mysql database to wordpress and joomla.

"docker-compose up" just by typing this single command our 3 different operating systems having mysql database server, wordpress and joomla are launched, that is the power of docker compose. 

# Thank you ._.
Vimal sir for providing this training and motivation.
